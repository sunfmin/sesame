# What a release is made of, one step per subcommand. The fleet cuts each
# version on a Mac by the cut steps of docs/agents/afkconvoy.md: `set` on the
# base branch, then `check`, `build`, `package`, `publish` at the tag's commit.
#
#   release.sh version                   the version Cargo builds
#   release.sh set <version>             <version> in Cargo.toml, and in Cargo.lock
#   release.sh check <tag>               fail unless <tag> is v<version>
#   release.sh build                     both macOS binaries, Apple Silicon and
#                                        Intel, on rustup's stable toolchain
#   release.sh package                   what was built, checked, to
#                                        dist/sesame-<version>-macos-<arch>.tar.gz
#   release.sh formula                   the Homebrew formula for what is in dist/
#   release.sh publish                   what is in dist/ to the tap: the archives
#                                        to its release sesame-v<version>, the formula
#                                        to Formula/sesame.rb. `gh` and `git`
#                                        must be allowed to write to the tap.
#
# The archives go to the tap (sunfmin/homebrew-tap) beside every other
# formula of it, the same way as afkconvoy's.
